      <h1>Star Wars &mdash; Classic Collection</h1>
      <h2>A New Hope</h2>
      <p>Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!</p>
      <p>I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.</p>
      <p>They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader.</p>
      <p>What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.</p>
      <p>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.</p>
      <p>What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?</p>
      <p>Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.</p>
      <p>The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.</p>
      <p>To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.</p>
      <p>Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted.</p>
      <h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>
      <p>Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.</p>
      <p>You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too.</p>
      <h3>I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.</h3>
      <p>This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!</p>
      <p>What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!</p>
      <p>Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.</p>
      <h2>Return of the Jedi</h2>
      <p>You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack</p>
      <p>Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too.</p>
      <p>Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.</p>
      <p>Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. </p>
      <p>I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish.</p>
